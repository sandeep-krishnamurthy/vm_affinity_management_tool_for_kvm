To install virtinst and the associated utilities (virt-install, ...),
run the command:

    python setup.py install

Please see http://docs.python.org/inst/standard-install.html for more info
on the standard python install process.

If installing from an upstream checkout, the 'man' pages may not be up to
date. You can force man page generation (which will be picked up by the next
'install' command) with:

    python setup.py sdist

An RPM can be built and placed in the local rpmroot with:

    python setup.py rpm

Note this RPM has been catered to Fedora/Red Hat distros, but may work
elsewhere..

For translators, running:

    python setup.py refresh_translations

Will regenerate po/virtinst.pot and merge existing translations with the
new template file.
